Material_Navigationdrawer
=========================

I liked the new Navigation Drawer introduced in the new Play Store app, so I wanted it in my own app.
I hoped Android Studio would automagically create it for me if I made a project targetting Lollipop and chose to have the Navigation Drawer.
Sadly, this was not the case.

After some googling, I modified the initially created project to work with the new fancy animation.
It worked, so I even added in a little extra: dynamically colored Toolbars and Statusbars, also on Kitkat!

Take a look at the code and have fun with it!
